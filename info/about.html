     <h1>About Me</h1>
     
   <p>My name is Maliya. Currently, I am studying political science and creative coding. Political activism and writing is something I hope I can connect with my computer science interests in the future. 
   
  <p> My inspiration stems from Angela Davis and other women leaders like Benazir Bhutto and Tarja Halonen. These women encourage and motivate me everyday that we still have a lot to achieve in terms of equality in society. When I read about all of their accomplishments and what they have done for human rights, I think to myself that I want to make a similar change after higher education someday. Growing up poor in the U.S and struggling with my culture did not mean I was bound by the same struggles women in my home of Kashmir were.  It made me realize that I must be the voice of those who are silenced and have no way to speak for themselves. </p>

<p> Today, many men and women feel a womans place is in the home. This is just one of the many value assumptions that our society places on women. For many years, I assumed my house held liberal ideals. Coming from a single parent home, I thought my mother, who raised me to be a strong individual, was open-minded. However, I was wrong. As I grew older, my views and values, although somewhat similar to those of my mothers, somehow turned out to be different. Ever since I can remember, my mother has always worked and provided a decent home for me and my sister. She always taught us to be independent and to never depend on anyone, so you can imagine I was surprised when she told me that it is a womans duty to take care of her man. My mother believes that a woman is supposed to serve her husband and the husband controls everything in the home. She also feels that a woman is not lady-like if she does not wear a dress. What exactly is lady-like?  Why must a woman carry such responsibility?  Questions like these triggered my search for my own identity as a woman and who I wanted to be. I began to think about my own standards and what I truly wanted from life.</p>

  <p> This is the reason  I want my poetry and work to resonate with other women of color who are told they should not pursue their dreams.</p>
