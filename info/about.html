     <h1>About Me</h1>
     
   <p>My name is Maliya. Currently, I am studying political science and creative coding. Political activism and writing is something I hope I can connect with my computer science interests in the future. 
   
  <p> My inspiration stems from Angela Davis and other women leaders like Benazir Bhutto and Tarja Halonen. These women encourage and motivate me everyday that we still have a lot to achieve in terms of equality in society. When I read about all of their accomplishments and what they have done for human rights, I think to myself that I want to make a similar change after higher education someday. </p>
