    <h1>My Poetry </h1>
    <h2> COLORS </h2>
    <p> I tried  to  blend  my  pastel  blue  and  lilac  soul with  your  heart,  but  you  were  too saturated. </p>
    <p> You  could not  compliment  my  vibrant  and  intense  strokes.</p>
    <p> Instead,  you  left splatters of monochromatic colors on the walls. </p>
    <p> They still linger in my mind. Oh, how I wished I could repaint us.</p>
        
       
        
       <h2>RAGE</h2>
       <p>I want to bleed into you all of the things I have known, that way you could understand the war that plagues my mind. 
       <p>For, I really need to make sure I engrave your heart with all the things that I have seen, all that I have felt.</p> 
       <p>And most of all entrust you with the wirings of my mind.</p>
       
       <h2>GROWING</h2>
       
       <p>It's 3AM, the autumn air smells of old books and candle fire.<p>
       <p>For, I am content.</p>
       <p>Like city lights stationed in dark streets, I am growing. </p>
       
       <h2>INSAINITY</h2>
       <p>I wanted someone to touch upon this insanity to understand it, to admire it, to not fear it, to see this insanity for what it really was. </p>
        <p>I have not lost my mind, I have finally found it.</p>
        <p>If only you had saw that, instead you misinterpreted my passions and compared them to normalcy.</p>
         <p>And well, that was where you fell short.</p>
     <p>My passions could never be normal. </p>
     <p>They were wickedly extraordinary.</p>
      
     <h2>BURN</h2>
     <p>I ache, I burn, and feel everything so very deeply.</p>
   <p>The books I read, the music I listen to, the coffee shops I visit, the people I talk to, I give and give, not asking for anything in return.</p>
    <p>But they too give to me.</p>
<p>In secret I turn them into poetry.</p>

<h2>CRITICS</h2>   

<p>Her life is a flickering flare surrounded by a dark abyss, each spark of happiness dulls in intensity.</p>  
<p>Light repels her.</p>
<p> How can she escape the thoughts that plague her mind?</p>
<p>It entices her, summons her being, it ignites her soul, it lights up her essence.Its what makes her tick.</p>
<p>Now, she is in ruins, but she does not mind it.</p>
<p>Not realizing the consequences, she slowly begins to perish.</p>
<p>She is infused with madness forver, her thoughts will live forver, with her-in her. She is her own worst critic.</p>
