    <p>My inspiration when it comes to creating visual images are from the following artists:</p>
    
				<h2>Shahzia Sikander </h2>

				<p>She is an pakistani artist based in New York City best known for her Mughal miniature painting as well as her Persian miniature painting. Sikander is also a performance artist, a muralist, a mixed media artist, and an installation artist. Having been taught the art of miniature painting in the traditional Pakistani technique, she adds her own modern take on the pieces, making her art unique. She plays a significant role in her work as well as her personal life, due to her Muslim beliefs. </p>

<p> Through her work, she explores how Muslim women are challenged by the Western way of living. She has been known to wear a veil in public, though she did not do so prior to her relocation to the United States. She does so as an experiment to study how Westerners are affected by the tradition. Sikander attended the National College of Arts in Lahore and earned her Bachelor of Fine Arts in 1992. 

<p> She studied at the Rhode Island School of Design, and in 1995 she earned her Master of Fine Arts. Sikander's first solo exhibition took place in 1993 at the Pakistan Embassy in Washington, D.C. Many solo exhibitions followed, taking her to such places as the Whitney Museum of American Art at Philip Morris in New York in 2000 and The San Diego Museum of Art in California in 2004. In addition to the solo exhibitions, Sikander also participated in many group exhibitions, including those held at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 2005 and Museum Ludwig in Germany in 1999. Sikander received a number of awards, including the Shakir Ali Award/Kipling Award from the National College of Arts, Lahore in 1993, The Joan Mitchell Award in 1999, and the MacArthur Fellows Program in 2006. Sikander continues to impart her personal touch and some political and social views into what may be considered to be an impersonal and disciplined tradition. She continues to exhibit work all over the world and adjust her work to reflect the current status of her culture.</p>

					<p>He is an Iraqi artist renowned for his use of traditional Arabic calligraphy in his works. Massoudy often bases his compositions on texts from poets, authors, and philosophers from both the Arab and European culture. "Despite the fact that the codes of beauty differ from one civilization to another, everyone can take something from them and enrich their soul or their art," he has said. "I like the Zen gardens of Kyoto, the ordered ceramics of Isfahan, a painting by Holbein, but also Picassos broken lines." Born in 1944 in Najaf, Iraq, Massoudy moved to Baghdad in the early 1960s to study calligraphy. In 1969, he relocated to Paris to escape the rising conflicts in his country. Here he enrolled at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, where he studied a number of traditional Western painting techniques.  After receiving his degree in 1975, Massoudy traveled through Europe with Arabesque, a work incorporating performance, music, poetry, and calligraphy. The artist continues to live and work in Paris, France.</p>

					<h2>Ayad Alkahdi</h2>

				</figure>

					<p>He is a New York Based, Iraqi born artist. Alkadhi's work focuses on the intersection of Near Eastern and Western culture, politics and religion. Arabic calligraphy and Middle Eastern references define much of his work.Born and raised in Baghdad, Iraq, Alkadhi left Iraq after the first Gulf War. He moved to the United States in 2000. Alkadhi graduated with an MFA from New York University, Tisch School of the Arts. He currently resides and works in New York City. Ayad Alkadhi is known for his painting "Price of a Barrel." It presents the artists gripping insight into the objectives of waging war against Iraq for oil and imperial dominance. The painting is also a reference to the heavily publicized atrocities at Abu Ghraib prison, which became the global persona of the US invasion. The work was inspired by a mothers response to a photograph of her son tortured in prison. She said she had wept as if she were the Virgin Mary looking up at her crucified son. While also revealing the costs of exploitation for a commercial commodity, Price of a Barrel is a homage to this mothers sorrow and strength.</p>

				<h2>Sonia Gechtoff</h2>

					<figcaption>*Abstract painting by Sonia*</figcaption>
				</figure>
				
                <p>She  began her career immersed in the heady culture of the San Francisco Bay Area Beat Generation, producing abstract paintings and drawings with tantalizing hints of figuration. Inspired by poetry, Gechtoff approaches her work with a belief in the expressive power of color, individual brushstrokes, and thickly applied oil paint. Many of her works, like The Angel (1953-55), are abstract self-portraits. Through vibrant colors and thick, energetic brushstrokes, Gechtoff creates the suggestion of a central figure, whose abundant arms-cum-wings stretch across the picture plane. Later in her career, after moving to New York, Gechtoff began drawing inspiration from the Brooklyn Bridge, classical architecture, and the sea, whose forms are recognizable in her later series of flat, understated, collage-like paintings.</p>
