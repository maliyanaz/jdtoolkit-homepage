		<p> My name is Maliya Naz. Currently, I write for the Muslim Girl editorial. My poetry has also appeared on Hikayaat Magazine. 
		In my free time I enjoy volunteering to help marginalized communities. 
		I am passionate about human rights as Islam encourages all Muslims to stand up against oppression.  </p>
